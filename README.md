# Calculator-DSA-Midterm
Calculator with C++ for Data Structures and Algorithm Midterm.

It this project we created a scientific calculator coding that uses stack that is basically a container that stores elements in a last-in first-out (LIFO) order.
This method promises a correct way of calculation, in order with the mathematical route towards calculations.

Users would get to enter a series of working under one line instead of doing it multiple times. 
The calculations includes:
-addition, subtraction, division and multiplications
-trigonometries (sine, cosine, tangent, sinh, cosh, tanh)
-logarithm and surds

with these in mind the calculator promises a function almost similar towards the scientific calculator itself.
